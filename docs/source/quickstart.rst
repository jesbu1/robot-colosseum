Quickstart
==========

Once you're done setting up ``PyRep``, ``RLBench``, and ``Colosseum``, you can
start interacting with the benchmark via various scripts we provide. Note that
you have to activate your virtual environment, and call ``setup_pyrep`` when
starting from a new terminal. Also, make sure you have setup ``Colosseum`` in
developer mode by using ``pip install -e .`` with the ``-e`` option.

1. Visualize and use variations
--------------------------------
We'll start by showing how to visualize demonstrations for a task and how to
enable and tweak variations using config files.

1.1 Visualizing a task
++++++++++++++++++++++
Our first step will be to visualize one of the tasks from the benchmark. Let's
say we what to visualize some demonstrations of the expert policy for the task
``close_box``. We can make use of the ``visualize_task`` script to do so, as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m colosseum.tools.visualize_task --config-name close_box

The script is also exposed as a console script in the ``setup.py`` file, so you
can also call it directly like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   visualize_task --config-name close_box

``CoppeliaSim`` should open up and start collecting some demonstrations from the
requested task.

   Visualizing the task ``close_box``.

1.2 Enabling variations
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Associated with each task there are 4 files, which we explain below for the
task ``close_box``:

.. figure:: /_static/img_task_related_files.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   The four types of files associated with every task in ``Colosseum``


- ``close_box.ttm``: This is the ``CoppeliaSim`` model representing the task itself.
  It contains all the objects and waypoints required for the task to be executed.
  Note that for RLBench tasks, this is one of the files provided as part of the
  task itself. You usually don't have to change this file if you just want to use
  the task and take demonstrations from it.

- ``close_box.py``: This is the other resource used by RLBench to represent a
  given task. It contains the wiring of objects, sensors, and conditiions for
  the task to be successfull.

- ``close_box.json``: This file is related to ``Colosseum``, and we'll discuss
  more about it when we start using the data collection scripts.

- ``close_box.yaml``: This file is related to ``Colosseum``, and it's used to
  configure variations for the associated task. We'll show the ``env`` section
  of the ``yaml`` file to discuss how we can enable and use these variations.

.. code-block:: yaml

   env:
     task_name: "close_box"
     seed: 42
     scene:
       factors:
         - variation: object_color
           name: manip_obj_color
           enabled: False
           targets: [box_base, box_lid]
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: object_texture
           name: manip_obj_tex
           enabled: False
           targets: [box_base, box_lid]
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: object_size
           name: manip_obj_size
           enabled: False
           targets: [box_base]
           scale_range: [0.75, 1.15]
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: light_color
           enabled: False
           targets: [DefaultLightA, DefaultLightB, DefaultLightD]
           color_range: [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: table_texture
           enabled: False
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: table_color
           enabled: False
           color_range: [[0.25, 0.25, 0.25], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: background_texture
           enabled: False
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: distractor_object
           enabled: False
           targets: [spawn_boundary0]
           num_objects: 2
           seed: ${env.seed}

         - variation: camera_pose
           enabled: False
           targets: [cam_front,
                    cam_over_shoulder_left,
                    cam_over_shoulder_right]
           euler_range: [[-0.05, -0.05, -0.05], [0.05, 0.05, 0.05]]
           position_range: [[-0.1, -0.1, -0.1], [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]]
           seed: ${env.seed}

Notice the list in ``yaml`` that we have, consisting of the various variations
that are defined for this task. Notice also that all are disabled, because of
``enabled: False``. Let's activate one of these and vary its parameters; for that
we'll choose the ``MO_Color`` corresponding to the following section in the yaml
file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - variation: object_color
     name: manip_obj_color
     enabled: True
     targets: [box_base, box_lid]
     seed: ${env.seed}

We have enabled that variation, so if we visuaslize the task again we should see
the effect of this variation in action, as shown in the figure below:

.. figure:: /_static/gif_example_variation_enabled.gif
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Visualizing the task ``close_box`` with the variation ``MO_Color`` enabled.

For this variation we can notice that there are 5 arguments we have to provide
in the corresponding ``yaml`` file, as an element of a ``yaml`` list, which are:

- ``variation``: The type of variation to be used, in this case ``object_color``.
- ``name``: An optional argument to identify this variation from others.
- ``enabled``: Whether or not the variation is enabled by default.
- ``targets``: A list of shapes that this variation will handle. We have to check
  the ``.ttm`` file using the ``task_builder`` to look for the names of the objects
  we want our variations to handle.
- ``seed``: The seed to be used for the random number generator.

.. note:: These arguments are not the only ones. Each variation has a different
   set of arguments that allow to configure it according to our needs. We'll see
   more of these in the ``API Reference``.

Let's change the set of colors that we can sample from and select only red, green
and blue colors. For this, we can update that section of the ``yaml`` file to the
following. Also, let's make sure that both objects handled by the variation are
the same color:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - variation: object_color
     name: manip_obj_color
     enabled: True
     targets: [box_base, box_lid]
     seed: ${env.seed}
     color_names: [red, green, blue]
     color_same: True

The resulting demonstrations are shown below. Notice that for the red case the
motion planner failed at the task, and continued with another episode.

.. figure:: /_static/gif_example_variation_tweak.gif
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Visualizing the task ``close_box`` with the variation ``MO_Color`` enabled and
   with some modifications.

2. Collect demonstrations
--------------------------------
Colosseum comes with some scripts that will help us collect demonstrations from
the tasks. We'll start by using the simpler script.

2.1 Collecting demonstrations for current ``yaml`` config
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``collect_demo.py`` script can be used to collect demonstrations from a single
task according to the current configuration of its associated ``yaml`` file. Let's
collect some demonstrations from the ``open_drawer`` task.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m colosseum.tools.collect_demo --config-name open_drawer

Similarly, we could use the console script ``collect_demo`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   collect_demo --config-name open_drawer

If everything went well, you should see the following output in your terminal:

.. figure:: /_static/img_collecting_demos_1.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

   Output of the ``collect_demo`` script.

We should get also our demonstrations in the ``/tmp/rlbench_data`` folder.

.. figure:: /_static/img_collecting_demos_2.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Demonstrations collected for the task ``open_drawer``.

Note that we got **5** demonstrations for only the **front rgb** camera. These
settings come from the ``yaml`` file itself, from the ``data`` section of the
file, shown below:

.. code-block:: yaml

   data:
     # Where to save the demos
     save_path: /tmp/rlbench_data/
     # The size of the images to save
     image_size: [128, 128]
     # The renderer to use. Either opengl or opengl3. The first has no shadows
     renderer: opengl3
     # The number of episodes to collect per task
     episodes_per_task: 5
     # The image types that will be recorded
     images:
       rgb: True
       depth: False
       mask: False
       point_cloud: True
     # The cameras that we will be enabled
     cameras:
       left_shoulder: False
       right_shoulder: False
       overhead: False
       wrist: False
       front: True
     # Store depth as 0 - 1
     depth_in_meters: False
     # We want to save the masks as rgb encodings.
     masks_as_one_channel: False

To visually check that we are using indeed those settings (e.g. image size), we
can generate a video from the demonstration using ``ffmpeg``. Navigate to the
folder for one demonstration (where all the image files are located) and run this
command to generate a video:

.. code-block:: bash

   ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i %d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p video_open_drawer.mp4

The resulting video is shown below:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <video autoplay muted loop width="512" height="512">
         <source src="_static/video_open_drawer_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    </div>

In the data section of the ``yaml`` file we can change various options like the
number of demonstrations to collect, from which cameras we should collect observations,
and which type of information can be collected. Let's modify the image size to
``[512, 512]``, collect 10 demonstrations instead of 5, and collect also from the
other available cameras. The resulting ``yaml`` should look something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   data:
     # Where to save the demos
     save_path: ${oc.env:HOME}/dataset/rlbench_data
     # The size of the images to save
     image_size: [512, 512]
     # The renderer to use. Either opengl or opengl3. The first has no shadows
     renderer: opengl3
     # The number of episodes to collect per task
     episodes_per_task: 10
     # The image types that will be recorded
     images:
       rgb: True
       depth: False
       mask: False
       point_cloud: True
     # The cameras that we will be enabled
     cameras:
       left_shoulder: True
       right_shoulder: True
       overhead: True
       wrist: True
       front: True
     # Store depth as 0 - 1
     depth_in_meters: False
     # We want to save the masks as rgb encodings.
     masks_as_one_channel: False

If everything went well, we should see the following output in our terminal:

.. figure:: /_static/img_collecting_demos_3.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

   Output of the ``collect_demo`` script after modifying the ``yaml`` file.

Again, we can go to the folder of one of the demonstrations and generate a video
using ``ffmpeg``, as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i %d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p video_open_drawer.mp4

.. raw:: html

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <video autoplay muted loop width="512" height="512">
         <source src="_static/video_open_drawer_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    </div>


You can use this data collection script to collect very specific demonstrations.
As you could notice, we haven't activated variations yet when collecting demos.


2.2 Collecting demonstrations for all variations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

So far we have collected demonstrations from a single task, and we showed how to
enable variations for that task via its associated config file. We could just
use these mechanisms to start collecting demonstrations for all variations; the
only problem is that it would be very tedious and time consuming to change the
variation settings each time we want to collect demonstrations for different
variations settings. We have partially automated that process by providing two
scripts that you can use to collect demonstrations from all variations active
one by one. First, we have to show you the **Benchmark Spreadsheet** where you
will be able to see all tasks variations and which ones are not supported for
the moment.

.. figure:: /_static/img_benchmark_spreadsheet.png
   :target: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/175cCG9qHzNB6axSno6K2NjQ9gjpbCqNK9GCi-SAQkCM/edit?usp=sharing
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   The Benchmark Spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet is located at the root of the repo, and called ``colosseum_tasks_distribution.xlsx``.
There you can find all the tasks available and their corresponding variations which,
as you can see by the colors, not always are supported for all tasks. The colors
mean the following:

- ``Blank``: The variation is supported without any issues
- ``Gray``: The variation does not apply for that specific case (e.g. no Receiving Object)
- ``Red``: The variation should be applicable, but it's currently not supported.

Notice also that the variations factors are indexed by and ``idx`` number, which
uniquely identifies it among all variation factors. For example, note that the
``MO_Color`` has index ``idx=2``, whereas ``camera_pose`` has index ``idx=14``. We
make use of these indices to activate and deactivate variations accordingly. So,
with this information we chose the option of using ``.json`` files for each task,
and in each one we enable or disable variations accordingly. Let's take a look at
a section of the ``json`` file associated for the ``open_drawer`` task.

                {"type": "camera_pose", "name": "any", "enabled": false}
            ]
        },

Each group in this data collection config corresponds to a different ``idx``, which
represents a specific variation, or could represent a specific set of conditions, like
``idx=0``, which corresponds to the no-variations case. For completeness we list
all currently available ``idx`` values:

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Index ``idx``   | Associated variation or configuration                      |
+=================+============================================================+
| ``idx=0``       | No variation factors are enabled                           |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``idx=1``       | All ``Colosseum`` variation factors are enabled            |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``idx=2``       | ``MO_Color`` is enabled                                    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``idx=3``       | ``RO_Color`` is enabled                                    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``idx=4``       | ``MO_Texture`` is enabled                                  |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``idx=5``       | ``RO_Texture`` is enabled                                  |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

The script that makes use of this information is the modified ``dataset_generator.py``
file, which you can locate at ``colosseum.tools.dataset_generator``. This script
accepts a task as input and collect for that task all configured variations in its
corresponding ``json`` file. So for some tasks it will collect all 16 ``idxs``,
whereas for others were some variations don't apply or are not supported it will
collect a fewer number of variations. Note that the script will be in charge of
enabling and disabling variations according to the ``json`` file, so we don't have
to do so manually in the ``yaml`` file. Below we show how to call this script for
the task ``open_drawer``.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m colosseum.tools.dataset_generator --config-name open_drawer

Or using the console script:

.. code-block:: bash

   dataset_generator --config-name open_drawer

This leads to the final script that we'll discuss in this section, the ``collect_dataset.sh``
script. It's just a bash script that calls the previous script every time for all
tasks.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./collect_dataset.sh

This script has some properties exposed, which we show below:

.. code-block:: bash

   # idx from which to collect demos (use -1 for all idxs)
   IDX_TO_COLLECT=-1
